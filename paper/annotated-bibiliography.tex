C++ is an extremely popular programming language for systems tasks. However,
that has not stopped language designers from trying to improve upon its
design. Two languages, D and Rust, are often hailed as possible successors of
the language. This project aims to examine how both languages attempt to
improve upon the design of C++ and evaluate the expressiveness of both.
