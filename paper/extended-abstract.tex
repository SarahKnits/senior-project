\abstract{The programming languages D and Rust aim to simplify the complex and
error-prone features of C++ while maintaining a similar level of performance.
This paper examines whether the languages succeed in their goal of easing the
development of safe code, specifically focusing on each language's compile-time
features and memory management techniques. C++, D, and Rust are evaluated on
both subjective and empirical criteria. In order to evaluate the success of
each language's design goals, I will implement a number of small programs that
encompass common tasks in systems programming, each in C++, D, and Rust. I will
then recruit volunteers with prior experience with C++ to attempt to implement
each program in D or Rust. Each volunteer will document his or her development
process in detail, particularly noting any errors or bugs that might be
encountered. Each error programmers will be tallied and categorized to analyze
whether a particular language makes it easier to avoid certain errors. I will
also conduct a readability study to see if D and Rust novices can identify
errors in programs. Lastly, I will evaluate each language on expressiveness and
ease of development to determine whether the language's design goals have been
met.}
