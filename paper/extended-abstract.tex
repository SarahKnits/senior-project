\abstract{The programming languages D and Rust aim to simplify the complex and
error-prone features of C++ while keeping the same performance. In this paper,
I aim to examine whether the languages succeed in their goal of easing the
process of writing memory-safe code. Over the course of the project, I will
implement a number of small programs in C++, D, and Rust that demonstrate the
differences between the languages, how a programmer might accomplish idioms
such as RAII in each, and common tasks in systems programming. I will evaluate
each language on expressiveness and ease of development to determine whether
the design goals of each language has been met.}
